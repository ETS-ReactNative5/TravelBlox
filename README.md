<summary><em> Reason behind this project </em></summary> 
<blockquote>
<p> Pandemic has stopped a lot of travel plans in the past few years. Recently locations around the world are beginning to open for travels, I think it's the perfect timing to build a travel planning website.  :wink: </p>

<p>
I've been planning my trips with spreadsheets and note takers, in which I had to switch platforms between calendars, maps and a lot times many personal travel blogs for planning ideas.

So here it is, **TravelBlox** that puts everything altogether :blush: :sparkling_heart:
